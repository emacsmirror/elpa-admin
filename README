This branch contains the sources, deployment scripts, and auxiliary
files for [[https://elpa.gnu.org/][GNU ELPA]].

This file explains the branch layout, how to add and edit packages,
and how to deploy the archive (either on =elpa.gnu.org=, or a local copy
for testing purposes).


* Getting the source

Start with source that is cloned directly from Savannah.  See [[https://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=emacs][the Savannah page]]
and look for "ELPA".  Using a clone of a clone does not work.

* Directory layout

** =admin/=    -- scripts for administering the package archive.
** =html/=     -- HTML for the elpa.gnu.org website.
** =packages/= -- source code for the packages.


* Packages

** Contents of the =packages/= directory:
This directory holds the package sources, with one subdirectory for
each package.

Each directory in here corresponds to a package, which can be
either a single-file package or a multifile package.

A nightly cron job refreshes the GNU ELPA archive from this repository.

This cron job only creates a new package when the "version" (as specified in
the =Version:= header) of a package is modified.  This means that you can
safely work on the next version here without worrying about the unstable
code making it to GNU ELPA, and simply update the "version" when you want to
release the new code.

** To add a package: (submission, submit)

Adding a basic package is very simple.  There are thorough
instructions below, but the gist of it is that you:

1. Notify [[mailto:emacs-devel@gnu.org][emacs-devel@gnu.org]].
2. Push your package's code to its branch on elpa.git with:

   #+begin_src shell
   git push elpa <mybranch>:refs/heads/externals/<pkgname>
   #+end_src

   where =<mybranch>= will probably be =master= for most people.

3. Edit the =externals-list= file to add an entry for =<pkgname>=.
   It has to have an =:external= property specified but that
   property can be nil.
4. =git add externals-list=, =git commit= and =git push=.

If you don't have push access to the repository, someone will do steps
2-4 for you.

*** Notify emacs-devel@gnu.org

There is no approval process for GNU ELPA packages.  Still,
you must send an email to =emacs-devel= for several reasons:

- Notifying other developers;
- Making sure the package doesn't break FSF rules;
- Checking if the package is not reinventing the wheel;
- Ensuring that first-time developers are doing it right.

Before doing anything, please ensure your package follows the
conventions described in the [[Format]] section.  Then, send an email
to the list with the subject:
 :  [ELPA] New package: <pkg-name>

Start your message with an explanation about the package.  A
copy-paste of the package's =Summary= and =Commentary= is perfectly fine
here, but you can write more or less than that if you'd like.

At the bottom of the message contents include the changes you're going
to make (the patch).  For a single-file package this can be the
package file itself instead of the patch.  If you prefer (and if you
have push access), you can push your changes to a branch called
=scratch/<pkg-name>=, and mention the branch in your message.

After 48 hours, or once any issues have been addressed, someone will push
your changes for you.  You should probably also subscribe to
[[https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/emacs-devel][emacs-devel@gnu.org]], since that's where we discuss about GNU Elpa, and
to [[https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/bug-gnu-emacs][bug-gnu-emacs@gnu.org]], since that's where people will report bugs
about your package.

*** Add a simple (1-file) package as =packages/<pkg-name>/<pkg-name>.el.=

The file needs to follow the usual coding conventions (most importantly start
with =";;; <file> --- <description> -*- lexical-binding: t -*-"=) and have a
=Version:= and =Maintainer:= pseudo-header (see the [[Format]] subsection
below).

For some examples, see [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Simple-Packages.html][Simple Packages]] (web link) or in Emacs:
#+begin_src elisp
    (info "(elisp) Simple Packages")
#+end_src

*** Add a multi-file package as a directory: =packages/<pkg-name>=

It needs to have a file named =packages/<pkg-name>/<pkg-name>.el= which follows the
same rules as above.  Note that if your package is large, we recommend you
add it as an "external" into its own branch, see below discussion of
[[External branches][external branches]].

It additionally follows the same guidelines described in [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Multi_002dfile-Packages.html][Multi-File Packages]]
(web link) or in Emacs
#+begin_src elisp
    (info "(elisp) Multi-file Packages")
#+end_src
with the exception that it is not a tar package (it's a plain
directory) and it must not contain a =<pkg-name>-pkg.el= file (this
will be created for you).

*** Check the copyright

Now run =make check_copyrights=.

That command does a very crude check to try and catch the files which lack
the usual license and copyright blurb (that's the role of the first =find=),
and to catch the files which still have a "copyright <not-the-fsf>" somewhere.

If your package fails that check, please fix the files accordingly.
Of course, occasionally those checks misfire (for a few rare files which
we admitted without their copyright being transferred to the FSF, or
because the word "copyright" appears in the body of the file), in
which case the right fix is to update the =copyright_exceptions= file.

*** Commit your changes the usual way (=git add=, =git commit=, etc.)

Changes in the Git repository do not immediately propagate to the
user-facing archive (what users see when they do =M-x list-packages=).
That is done by deploying the archive, which happens automatically
once a day, and the changes are only reflected when the =Version:=
header changes.

** Format

Each package should follow the ELPA packaging conventions, but there are
some differences due to the way the deployment script creates the packages
and the web-pages from this source code:
- Multi-file packages put the package metadata in the main =<pkg-name>.el= file
  in the format used for single-file packages: the =<pkg-name>-pkg.el= file is
  auto-generated from it.
- Every package should have both a =Version:= /and/ a =Maintainer:=.
- The =URL:= header can be used to specify the home page
  of the package, if it's maintained externally.
- A =News:= section (or "NEWS" file) can/should be used to list the
  user-visible changes of each version.
- The =Package-Type:= header can be used to force the type of package
  created (can be either =simple= for single-file packages or =multi= for
  tarballs).  By default the type is decided based on whether there are
  several Elisp files in the source.
- If you want some files to not be included in the tarball, you can
  put a =.elpaignore= file in the root of your package directory, where you
  can list patterns of files to ignore (this file is passed to =tar='s =-X=).

** Coding style

We do not impose a particular coding style on GNU ELPA packages, but of
course we recommend the coding style used in Emacs's own source code.
Furthermore we recommend the following:
- Use =cl-lib= rather than =cl= if at all possible.
- Use =lexical-binding= if at all possible.
- Try and fix the warnings emitted when compiling the package with a recent Emacs.

The Copyright notice should specify "Free Software Foundation, Inc." as
the copyright holder.  Ensure that all the code has the proper copyright:
if it is not your own code, make sure the author has signed the relevant
copyright papers (for non-trivial contributions), and indicate the author
correctly in the commit.

** External branches

The above instructions are enough to add regular packages, those that
are maintained primarily here in the repository and are fairly small.
The instructions below are for those maintainers who prefer to use a dedicated
repository or branch for the package or for largish packages.

In any case, a copy of the code is kept in the =elpa.git= repository
(not in the =master= branch) and should be sync'd with the
upstream every once in a while.  This copy may include local changes,
although these should be kept to a minimum.

The copy of the code is not kept in =master= but in the
=externals/<pkg-name>= branch in the =elpa.git= repository.

To add a new external package, first add this =elpa.git= repository as a
new remote in your existing repository.

Then push a local branch to a
new remote branch in =elpa.git=, named =externals/<pkgname>=.  For example:

#+begin_src shell
   git push elpa <mybranch>:refs/heads/externals/<pkgname>
#+end_src

For example, let's say that you want to add =realgud-ipdb= which is currently
checked out in =$HOME/github/realgud-ipdb=:

#+begin_src shell
   cd $HOME/github/realgud-ipdb
   git remote add elpa ${USER}@git.sv.gnu.org:/srv/git/emacs/elpa.git
   git push elpa master:refs/heads/externals/realgud-ipdb
#+end_src

Then edit the =externals-list= file as mentioned above, add the line

#+begin_src elisp
   ("realgud-ipdb" :external "https://github.com/realgud/realgud-ipdb")
#+end_src

and push that change to the master branch of =elpa=.  After it's added to
the =externals-list= file, the package can be maintained just by
pushing changes to the =externals/<pkgname>= branch.

If you wish to check out all the external packages into the =packages=
directory, you can run the command:

#+begin_src shell
   make externals
#+end_src

You can check out a specific external =<pkgname>= into the =packages=
directory with these commands:

#+begin_src 
   cd packages
   git worktree add PACKAGE externals/<pkgname>
#+end_src

If you already have a =packages/<pkgname>= directory with a previous
checkout, you can update it like this:

#+begin_src 
   cd packages/PACKAGE
   git pull
#+end_src

** Public incubation

If you want to develop a package publicly prior to its first release (to
benefit from others' feedback, primarily), but not in an external repo,
you have two choices:
- you can simply put =Version: 0= to indicate that this should not be
  released yet.
- or you can push to an "ephemeral" branch -- subject to rebase and eventual
  removal upon finishing merge -- for the duration of the incubation.

* Deployment

** To install all the packages "in place":

#+begin_src shell
   make externals
   make
#+end_src

This compiles and generates autoloads for all the packages in the
=packages/= directory.  You can then add that directory, e.g. with:

#+begin_src elisp
(eval-after-load 'package
  '(add-to-list 'package-directory-list ".../elpa/packages"))
#+end_src

** To deploy the package repository as a remotely-accessible archive:

The deployment process creates sibling directories, so start by creating
a clean directory to work in:

#+begin_src shell
   mkdir elpa ; cd elpa
#+end_src

The above step is optional, but recommended.

#+begin_src shell
   git -c fetch.fsckObjects=false clone .../elpa
   (cd elpa; git clone .../emacs)    #If you want to generate :core packages.
   mkdir build
   cd build
   (cd ../elpa; git log --format=%H | tail -n 1) >.changelog-witness
   ln -s ../elpa/admin
   ln -s ../elpa/GNUmakefile
   admin/update-archive.sh
#+end_src

This deploys the packages to the =staging/= directory (sibling of =build=).
Unlike =make=, this makes a full copy of the packages, tars up
multi-file packages, and doesn't byte-compile any files.

The =fetch.fsckObjects= setting works around a glitch in the ELPA
repository.  (See [[https://debbugs.gnu.org/22690][Bug#22690]].)

** To access a deployed archive

To access the archive via HTTP, have a symlink (say) =/var/www/packages=
pointing to =DEST/packages=, and set up Emacs with

#+begin_src elisp
  (setq package-archives '(("new-elpa" . "http://foo.com/packages")))
#+end_src

You can also access the archive via normal file access.  Such "local
archives" are useful for debugging:

#+begin_src elisp
  (setq package-archives '(("local-elpa" . ".../elpa/packages")))
#+end_src

** Notes specific to =elpa.gnu.org=

The way things are set up on this machine, we refresh the archive by
a cron job.  You can do it by hand by logging in (access set up by FSF
admins), and

#+begin_src shell
   su elpa
   cd ~elpa/build
   admin/update-archive.sh
#+end_src

Which makes a full archive deployment, as discussed above.  The symlink
=/var/www/packages= points to the staging package directory under
=/home/elpa/=.
